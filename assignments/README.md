Apedemak, with his fierce lion’s head, was a mighty warrior god in ancient Nubian and Egyptian mythology. He was a protector, someone people looked to when times were tough, especially in battle. Unlike other gods, Apedemak was not just about strength; he was about guiding and protecting those who fought for what they believed in. His image, often shown with the body of a man and the head of a lion, symbolized both power and protection. People knew he had their backs when things got rough.
This lion-headed god wasn’t just about war; he also represented the balance between chaos and order. Apedemak was worshipped mainly in Nubia, where he was seen as a divine guardian, someone who could turn the tide of battle and bring victory. His presence was believed to be a sign that no matter how fierce the fight, those under his protection had a chance to come out on top. He embodied the idea that true strength comes from both physical power and the courage to defend what’s right.

Three feature set targets:
•	the “low-bar “of you will create (this should still be a “complete game”):
To have an open-world environment, where the player can walk around and explore.
•	a target that you expect to get done:
For the player will fight against different types of creatures from the culture of Egypt. 
•	a desired high-bar if things go exceptionally well. Plan these out carefully, so that you can definitely achieve the first goal, and likely hit the second:
To create a day and night cycle for my game. Also, to have environmental sounds.
